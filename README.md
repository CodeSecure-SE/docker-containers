# docker-containers
Docker files to build various open source projects

This is set-up to build from Mark's Docker account, you will have to adjust the build.sh scripts to use a different account.

You will also need to grab the latest CodeSonar .tar.gz file and GitHub and GitLab integration files and put them in the same directory as the build.sh.
